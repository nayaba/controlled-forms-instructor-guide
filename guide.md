# Instructor Guide: Controlled Forms in React

## Introduction

Begin by explaining the importance of controlled forms in React applications. Emphasize how managing form inputs using component state allows for more predictable and efficient form handling.

---

## Visual Aid: Whiteboard Diagram

**Title: Controlled Forms in React**

Draw a flowchart to illustrate the relationship between state, input elements, and handler functions.

1. **State Variable** 
   - Draw a box labeled "State Variable (e.g., `cityInput`)".
   - Add an arrow pointing to "Input Element" labeled "Value".
   
2. **Input Element**
   - Draw a box labeled "Input Element".
   - Add an arrow pointing to "Handler Function" labeled "onChange".

3. **Handler Function**
   - Draw a box labeled "Handler Function (e.g., `handleChange`)".
   - Add an arrow pointing back to "State Variable" labeled "Updates State".

**Ask students**:  
- What role does state play in a controlled input?
- How does a handler function affect the input's state?

---

## Setup

Explain the setup process for creating a new Vite project, highlighting the necessary dependencies and configuration.

**Ask students**:
- Why do we use Vite to create a React project?
- What purpose do the ESLint rules serve in our project setup?

---

## Understanding Controlled Inputs

### Key Concepts

**Draw on Whiteboard:**

- **Virtual DOM vs. Real DOM**
  - Draw two columns: "Virtual DOM" and "Real DOM".
  - List the benefits of using the Virtual DOM for controlled forms.

**Ask students**:
- Why are controlled forms preferred in React?
- What problems do they solve compared to uncontrolled forms?

---

### Building a Controlled Input

1. **Initial Uncontrolled Input**

   Show the initial uncontrolled input code:

   ```jsx
   <label htmlFor="cityInput">City: </label>
   <input id="cityInput" name="cityInput" type="text" />
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - How does this input behave without state management?

2. **Adding State**

   Explain how to use the `useState` hook:

   ```jsx
   const [cityInput, setCityInput] = useState('');
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - What does the `useState` hook provide for our component?
   - What is the initial value of `cityInput`, and why?

3. **Value Prop**

   Demonstrate setting the input's value to state:

   ```jsx
   <input value={cityInput} />
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - Why doesn't the input display typed characters initially?

4. **Change Handler**

   Introduce the `handleChange` function:

   ```jsx
   const handleChange = (event) => {
     setCityInput(event.target.value);
   };
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - What does `event.target.value` represent in this context?
   - How does `setCityInput` update the input value?

## Managing Controlled Forms

### Creating a Controlled Form

1. **Initial Form Setup**

   Display the initial form structure:

   ```jsx
   <form>
     <label htmlFor="firstName">First Name: </label>
     <input id="firstName" name="firstName" />
   </form>
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - How is this form different from the previous single input?

2. **Adding State for Inputs**

   Explain the need for state management:

   ```jsx
   const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - What state variables are necessary to manage this form?

3. **Connecting State to Inputs**

   Illustrate connecting state to inputs:

   ```jsx
   <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - How do we ensure the input value is controlled by state?

### Refactoring State to a Single Object

1. **Initial State Refactor**

   Discuss consolidating state variables:

   ```jsx
   const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ firstName: '', lastName: '' });
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - What are the benefits of using a single state object for form data?

2. **Dynamic Handler Function**

   Explain the refactored handler function:

   ```jsx
   const handleChange = (event) => {
     setFormData({ ...formData, [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
   };
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - How does the spread operator (`...formData`) help in this function?
   - What does `[event.target.name]` represent?

---

## Handling Form Submission

### Submit Button and Function

1. **Adding a Submit Button**

   Show the addition of a submit button:

   ```jsx
   <button type="submit">Submit your name</button>
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - What is the purpose of specifying `type="submit"`?

2. **Handling Submit Events**

   Explain the `handleSubmit` function:

   ```jsx
   const handleSubmit = (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();
     setTitle(`Your name is: ${formData.firstName} ${formData.lastName}`);
     setFormData({ firstName: '', lastName: '' });
   };
   ```

   **Ask students**:
   - Why is `event.preventDefault()` necessary here?
   - How does this function update the title state?

---

## Conclusion

Summarize the key takeaways:

- Controlled inputs ensure form data is synchronized with React state.
- Refactoring state into a single object simplifies form management.
- Proper handling of form submissions prevents unwanted page reloads.

**Ask students**:
- What challenges do you anticipate when managing complex forms in React?
- How might you apply these concepts in a larger React application?

This guide should help you navigate through the lesson while engaging students with questions and visual aids, ensuring a thorough understanding of controlled forms in React.
